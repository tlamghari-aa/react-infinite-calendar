# Contributing to this project

First of all, thanks for contributing! Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **try not to** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/appannie/react-infinite-calendar)).
* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome.
But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.
Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help.
They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.)
